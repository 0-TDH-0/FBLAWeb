The purpose of this project was to create a program that filters our data points to give the user to potential visitors. Your program will allow users to search for attractions in the area based on desired attributes, such as location, type of attraction, and amenities. Your program must include at least 50 attractions, and users must be able to define at least five desired attributes to search for an attraction.
